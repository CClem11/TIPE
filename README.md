# SelfDrivingCar

TIPE : How to make a selfdriving car using neural network and genetic algorithms
-
* the car has 5 radars that give each an number between 0 and 1 (1 = no obstacle detected)
* the car is controlled by 3 numbers (between 0 and 1) : [acceleration, left, right]

Libraries
* pygame : for graphical interface
* tensorflow : to build, train the neural network that control the car
